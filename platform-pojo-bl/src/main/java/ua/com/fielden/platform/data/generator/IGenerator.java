/**
 * A contract to be used for implementing data generators. 
 * The main purpose of data generators that implement this contract is to be used by Entity Centres at their <code>run</code> phase to generate the data, which is then used for retrieval.
 * <p>
 * A typical example where this could be useful is some analysis, which computes the necessary data ad hoc, temporarily stores it and exposes for further interrogation via an Entity Centre.  
 * <p>
 * Another interesting use cases for it is the implementation of simple "wizards" where the source data for the resultant data, which needs to be produced by the wizard, is generated based on the specified selection criteria.
 * <p>
 * In these cases, the selection criteria values are used as parameters for a data generation algorithm.
 * <p>
 * It is expected that all concrete implementations of this contract will exists at the level of specific application DAO modules.
