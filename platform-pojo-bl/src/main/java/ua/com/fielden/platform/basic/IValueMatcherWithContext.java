 * A value matcher contract that required an execution context. The context is always some kind of entity.

 * The actual implementation of concrete value matchers is responsible for correctly using the provided context.

 * An interesting use case is where context is represented by a persistent entity and the matching logic depends on both the current (potentially not yet persisted) context and
 * on its persisted version. A concrete matcher implementation would be able to retrieve the persisted version by using an ID of the provided current context version.
