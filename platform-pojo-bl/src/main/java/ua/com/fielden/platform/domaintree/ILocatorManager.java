/**
 * {@link ILocatorManager} represents a manager for property related locators within some box-like entity (for e.g. entity-centre {@link ICentreDomainTreeManagerAndEnhancer} or
 * entity-master {@link IMasterDomainTreeManager}). There can be one locator associated with some {@link AbstractEntity}-typed property.
 * <p>
 * There are three <b>phases</b> of locator lifecycle: <br>
 * 1. <b>Usage</b> phase -- at this phase locator can be used for reading (don't forget to <b>refresh</b> it every time before usage and then <b>discard</b>)<br>
 * 2. <b>Editing</b> phase -- at this phase locator can be edited until it will be <b>accepted / discarded</b><br>
 * 3. <b>Freezed Editing</b> phase -- at this phase locator has been <b>freezed</b> and can be edited until it will be <b>accepted / discarded</b><br>
 * <p>
 * Current locator can be accessed using method <b>get</b>. At the very beginning of locator history it will be <code>null</code>. After first <b>refresh</b> locator will be
 * initialised from Global Representation. <b>Refresh</b> method also will override everytime it by fresh instance from Global Representation until it will become <i>LOCAL</i>.
 * <p>
 * Any action will throw {@link DomainTreeException} when the property is not of {@link AbstractEntity} type.
