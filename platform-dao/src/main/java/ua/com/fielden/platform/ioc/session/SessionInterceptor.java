/**
 * Intercepts methods annotated with {@link SessionRequired} to inject Hibernate session before the actual method execution. Nested invocation of methods annotated with
 * {@link SessionRequired} is supported. For example, method <code>findAll()</code> could invoke method <code>findByCriteria()</code> -- both with {@link SessionRequired}.
 * <p>
 * A very important functionality provided by this intercepter is transaction management:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the current session has no active transaction then it is activated and the current method invocation is marked as the one that should commit it.</li>
 * <li>If the current session has an active transaction then the current method invocation is marked as the one that should NOT commit it.</li>
 * <li>In case of an exception, which could occur during method invocation, the transaction is rollbacked if it is active and the exception is propagated up.</li> *
 * </ul>
 *
 * The last item ensures that any exception at any level of method invocation would ensure transaction rollback. If transaction is not active at the time of rollback then that
 * means it has already been rollbacked.
 *
 * Please note that transaction can be started outside of this intercepter, which means it will not be committed within it, and the transaction originator is responsible for
 * commit. At the same time, if an exception occurs then transaction will be rollbacked.
