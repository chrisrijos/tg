/**
 * This is an example of using {@link PublishSubject} for message broadcasting.
 * Messages are send to the stream from multiple tasks running on different threads.
 * <p>
 * In order to make sending messages to the stream thread safely by directly calling {@link Subject#onNext(Object)}, the instance of {@link PublishSubject} that represents the stream, is wrapped
 * into {@link SerializedSubject}.
 * <p>
 * There are two tasks that send messages to the stream every 2 and 4 seconds respectively.
 * These tasks can be thought of as emulating concurrent execution of some companion object save method by different users.
 * <p>
 * There are three observers that are subscribed to the stream, where the second observer gets unsubscribed after some time.
 * So, there are only two observers left at the end of the application lifecycle.
 * This emulates the situation where some clients may choose stop receiving messages subscribed to earlier (e.g. application was closed).
 * <p>
 * There is a separate termination task that completes the stream and shutdowns all the message sending tasks.
 * This results in the natural application completion.
